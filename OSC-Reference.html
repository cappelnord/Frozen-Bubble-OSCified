<h1>Frozen Bubble OSCified</h1>

<p>Frozen Bubble OSCified is a modified Version of the <a href="http://glenn.sanson.free.fr/v2/?select=fb:play">java port of Frozen Bubble</a>. The game itself hasn't changed that much, but the game sends OSC (Open Sound Control) Messages when certain events occur. The default host/port is <em>127.0.0.1:57120</em> <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net">(SuperCollider Language)</a>. This can be changed with the command line arguments <em>-host [host] -port [port]</em>. The following document describes all available OSC Messages. Please note that some events may seem redundant. Also naming and implimentation is often worse than i wanted it to be, after all it is just a hacked game.</p>

<p>Frozen Bubble OSCified can also be directly controlled over OSC. The game listens by default on port 57180, you can change the port with command line argument <em>-listen [port]</em>.</p>
