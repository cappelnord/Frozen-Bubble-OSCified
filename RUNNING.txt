You require Java 5 or later to run Frozen Bubble OSCified. 

On Mac OS X you can run Frozen Bubble OSCified by double-clicking on the FrozenBubble.jar file.
I didn't test it on any other Operating System, but the command ...

java -jar FrozenBubble.jar

... should always work!


For additional command-line options please take a look at OSC-Reference.html
